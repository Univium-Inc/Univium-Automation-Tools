Primary Starting Point: 
=======================
The primary starting file for this project is: 
"user-website-crawl.php"


Project Summary:
=================
This script performs an SEO Site Audit by crawling all the pages of a given Url, then analyzing
the contents of the pages crawled and scoring the pages and overall website according to specified criteria.


Working Example: 
=================
Given that this was designed for a previous client as a one time project, we do not have 
a public working example that can be reviewed. 

However, we hope to have a public working example for this project soon at https://univium.com
